{"google":"","body":"AIAnimationQueue\r\n================\r\n\r\nAn animation queue for UIView animations in Objective C\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAIAnimationQueue is a singleton that allows sequencing of code execution. AIAnimationQueue supports adding both animations and computations to the queue. The actions added to the queue will be performed sequentially. AIAnimationQueue supports passing code packed in both method and block forms. In addition, it also supports using arguments when passing a method (selector). Computation can be queued and used in exchange for losing the right to specify a didStopSelector in the animation.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPacking the Animation/Computation:\r\nWhen packing the animation make sure to leave out\r\n\r\n  \t[UIView beginAnimation:(NSString *)animationID context:(void *)context];\r\n  \t[UIView setAnimationDelegate:(id)target];\r\n  \t[UIView setAnimationDidStopSelector:(SEL)selector];\r\n  \t[UIView commitAnimation];\r\n\r\nYou should end-up with something like this:\t\r\n\r\n  \t- (void)animation {\r\n  \t\t[UIView setAnimationDuration:2.0];\r\n  \t\tlabel.frame = CGRectMake(0,0,0,0);\r\n  \t}\r\n  \t\r\nor in block form:\r\n\r\n  \tvoid(^block)(void) = : {\r\n  \t\t[UIView setAnimationDuration:2.0];\r\n  \t\t[label.frame = CGRectMake(0,0,0,0)];\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\nGetting the AIAnimationQeue object:\r\n\r\n\tAIAnimationQueue *aQueue = [AIAnimationQueue sharedInstance];\r\n\r\nAdding a selector-based animation:\r\n\t\r\n\tSEL selector = @selector(animation);\r\n\tid target = self;\r\n\t[aQueue addAnimation:selector target:target];\r\n\r\nAdding a block-based animation\r\n\r\n\tvoid(^block)(void) = animation;\r\n\t[aQueue addAnimation:block];\r\n\r\nComputations are added in much the same way except instead of using the addAnimation methods you would use the addComputation methods which accept the same parameters. AIAnimationQueue also supports passing parametrized selectors with examples available in TestViewController.m.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n* AIAnimationQueue supports only selector based animations and computations in iOS 3.2 and lower\r\n* AIAnimationQueue supports both selector based and block based animations and computations in iOS 4.0+\r\n\r\n","name":"Animation","tagline":"An Animation Queue for iOS","note":"Don't delete this file!
