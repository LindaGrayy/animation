animation

An animation queue for UIView animations in Objective C

Instructions
AIAnimationQueue is a singleton that can be accessed anywhere in your program.
To queue an animation simply call:

[[AIAnimationQueue sharedInstance] addAnimation:(SEL)aSelector target:(id)aTarget];

aSelector: a selector pointing to the method you've wrapped your function in
aTarget: the object in which that method resides

Animation Wrapping Format
Follow the normal UIView animation format except exclude the following 3 lines:
	- [UIView createAnimation:(NSString *)animationID withContext:(void *)context]
	- [UIView setAnimationDelegate:(id)delegate]
	- [UIView commitAnimation]
These 3 calls are done by the queue itself	

Compatibility

- This has not been tested with the new block features in iOS 4.0
