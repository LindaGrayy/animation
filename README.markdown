Tools for animation
=====================


I have been traveling these past few days and discover the number of artists along the way. Got three days to spend time in every animation and art event here in Japan and currently collaborating with the professionals. While having a conversation with someone in the Cosplay event she, as one of the artists introduced the art of animation in a simple way.

Below is the example of Anime created in various strokes and how it moves using various tools, including the EWC Presenter, Vcasmo, [payday loans Australia](http://www.perfectpayday.com.au), GoAnimate, PowToon and Mixeek. Check the animated result below.
